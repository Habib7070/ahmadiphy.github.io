	    My name is Abolfazl Ahmadi rahmat, I am very interested in the field of Complex Systems Physics.
	    My field of study is Statistical Physics (Complex Systems and Nonlinear Dynamics). I have a solid background in Programming, Computational methods and simulations (I started programming when I was 14).
	    Currently, I am a part-time (free) Researcher at Center for Theoretical Neuroscience at IPM, Tehran, Iran. and I am working on structural effects and causes of Alzheimer's disease, schizophrenia and Parkinson's disease, a complex system approach (dynamical complex network and phase transition).
	    Also, I am lecturer at Bu-Ali Sina University, Hamadan, Iran for this Fall.
	    I hold BSc degree in Solid State Physics and I have recently completed a master's in Solid State Physics (Condensed Matter) at the Shiraz University in Shiraz, Iran.
	    In my interest in Complex Biophysical Systems and Computational Neuroscience, My MSc thesis, supervised by Dr. Afshin Montakhab, was in the field of the criticality in the brain and my thesis topic is: Spreading Models with Critical Dynamics on Hierarchical Modular Networks: Neuroscience Implications (My dissertation grade is Excellent â€“ Highest grade ) .
	    I did two projects during my master degree, thesis project and Complex Systems course project. First one was on criticality and Griffiths phase in Hierarchical Modular Networks (real brain networks) and the other was a new algorithm to emerging of scale-free networks (with a new approach based on Self-Organize Criticality.
